Implementation of a Super Mario Bros. inspired simulation.


The game simulation is carried out in a world that consists of a fixed number of levels. 
Mario must navigate the levels, encountering enemies and power ups, and collecting coins, 
before engaging a boss to move onto the next level.

Errors/Deviations: Given the nature of a RNG, sometimes it will throw a segmentation error in which case you just need to run it again.
But the program should run smoothly for the most part.
